System: The error you're encountering, `Fatal error during insertion: Expected ',' or '}' after property value in JSON at position 1790`, indicates a JSON syntax issue in the `packages.json` file, specifically around character position 1790. This is causing the `JSON.parse` call in the `loadPackages` function of `utils.js` to fail. The provided `packages(4).json` snippet was incomplete, and while a corrected version was previously suggested, the persistent error suggests that the actual `packages.json` file used in the workflow contains additional malformed content, likely a missing comma or unclosed object/array.

### Root Cause
- The `loadPackages` function in `utils.js` attempts to parse `packages.json` using `JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('packages.json', 'utf8'))`.
- The error message indicates that at character position 1790, the JSON parser expected a comma (`,`) or a closing brace (`}`), suggesting issues like:
  - A missing comma between properties in an object or elements in an array.
  - An unclosed object (`{`) or array (`[`).
  - A trailing comma after the last property or element.
- The provided `packages(4).json` snippet was incomplete, ending mid-property (`"slug": "phoneNumber`), and the corrected version had 1719 characters. The error at position 1790 implies additional content in the actual `packages.json`, possibly a second object or malformed property.

### Debugging Steps
1. **Inspect packages.json at Position 1790**:
   - Open `packages.json` in a text editor with character position tracking (e.g., VS Code, which shows character position in the status bar).
   - Navigate to character 1790 to identify the problematic section. For example, if the file extends beyond the provided snippet, the issue might be in a second object or an incorrect property.
   - Common issues to look for:
     - Missing commas: e.g., `{ "key1": "value1" "key2": "value2" }` (missing comma after `"value1"`).
     - Trailing commas: e.g., `{ "key": "value", }`.
     - Unclosed brackets or braces: e.g., `{ "key": "value"`.

2. **Validate JSON Syntax**:
   - Validate the `packages.json` file using a JSON linter:
     ```bash
     npm install -g jsonlint
     jsonlint packages.json
     ```
   - Or use Node.js locally:
     ```bash
     node -e "try { JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('packages.json')); console.log('Valid JSON'); } catch (e) { console.error('Invalid JSON:', e.message); }"
     ```
   - Online JSON validators (e.g., jsonlint.com) can also help pinpoint the exact error.

3. **Use Debug Information**:
   - The previous workflow update included enhanced debugging in `utils.js`, which logs a snippet of the JSON around the error position. However, the error log you provided doesnâ€™t show the `[DEBUG] JSON content near error` output, possibly because the updated workflow wasnâ€™t used or the log was truncated.
   - Ensure the latest `deploy-calcom.yml` (provided below) is used, as it includes this debug logging.

4. **Correct packages.json**:
   - The provided `packages(4).json` was incomplete. A corrected version was suggested earlier, but the error at position 1790 suggests additional content. Below is the corrected version of the provided snippet. If your `packages.json` has more entries, ensure they are properly formatted with commas between objects and a closing array bracket:
